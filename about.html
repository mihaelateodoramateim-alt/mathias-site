        <h1>Engineering mindset. People first.</h1>
        <p class="lead">Founded in 2022 in Romania, Mathias IT Solutions blends the discipline of engineering with a practical approach to people and products.</p>

          <h2>Our Founder</h2>
          <p>Our founder is an engineer in <b>Electronics, Information Technology and Automation</b>. From an early age he dismantled and rebuilt devices, wrote code for fun, and tested ideas in real-life projects. He competed in numerous competitions and became a <b>national mathematics olympiad</b> laureate. That drive for excellence became the company’s north star.</p>
          <p>As the company grew, we kept a simple promise: do the simple things exceptionally well—then scale. We prefer clarity over buzzwords, and results over slides. We’ve learned that steady progress beats sporadic sprints.</p>

          <h2>What we stand for</h2>
          <blockquote>Excellence is a habit, not a goal.</blockquote>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Excellence over shortcuts</li>
            <li>Security by design</li>
            <li>Clear ownership and measurable outcomes</li>
            <li>Long-term partnerships and honest feedback</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We are small enough to care and experienced enough to deliver. That balance is our advantage.</p>
